# PSYQo

## What?
The PSYQo library is a object oriented C++ library for developing applications that run on the PlayStation 1. It is an opinionated yet lightweight and safe solution for modern development on the PS1.

## How?
Please refer to the [Getting Started](GETTING_STARTED.md) and [Concepts](CONCEPTS.md) pages for more information. While the library makes heavy use of C++, the surface API only requires some basic knowledge of C++. Still, the user of the library is encouraged to get familiar with C++ concepts such as [classes](https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/classes/), or [inheritance](https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/inheritance/).

The library makes uses of the [EASTL](https://github.com/electronicarts/EASTL), and is available to the user as a side effect. However, not all pieces of the library will be guaranteed to work properly at the moment. It has been modified to support the PlayStation1.

## Who?
The PSYQo library is developed by [the PCSX-Redux authors](https://pcsx-redux.consoledev.net/).
To discuss PlayStation1's development, hacking, and reverse engineering in general, please join the PSXDev Network Discord server: [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/642647820683444236)](https://discord.gg/QByKPpH)

## When?
The library can be seen in an alpha state at the moment, and is actively being developed. The next immediate features should include:

- [ ] Proper DMA chaining
- [ ] CDRom access
- [ ] Memory card access
- [ ] Better sound support
